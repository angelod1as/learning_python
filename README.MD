# Learning Python

This repo contains my study projects from my course at [Asimov academy](https://asimov.academy/).

## Before you say anything

I *can't* write Python. I'm learning it. Yeah, like a kid. The code might be smelly and dirty, but everyone needs to start from somewhere. This is my start.

## Contents

You will find the following folders:

- **locadora**: \nA simple car rental software (in PT-br) that runs in the terminal. You can pick multiple cars, decide how many days you'll rent them, and give them back to the shop.
- **test_venv**:\nA dummy project to test and understand python environments.
- **pysnake**: \nThe snake game! In python! This took a while, but the result is *almost* acceptable.
