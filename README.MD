# Learning Python

This repo contains my study projects from my course at [Asimov academy](https://asimov.academy/).

## Contents

The most important projects:

- **Fifa 2023**: \nPlayer and club data from Fifa 2023 displayed using Streamlit. [Here](https://github.com/angelod1as/fifa-streamlit).
- **locadora**: \nA simple car rental software (in PT-br) that runs in the terminal. You can pick multiple cars, decide how many days you'll rent them, and give them back to the shop. [Here](./Starter%20Course/locadora/).
- **pysnake**: \nThe snake game! In python! This took a while, but the result is *almost* acceptable. [Here](./Starter%20Course/pysnake/).

## Before you say anything

I *can't* write Python. I'm learning it. Yeah, like a kid. The code might be smelly and dirty, but everyone needs to start from somewhere. This is my start.
